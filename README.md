# bgdnandrew-DevOps

A collection of practical DevOps guides aimed at solving specific operational headaches for developers and system administrators.

## Philosophy

### Self-Hosting is a Superpower

In an era where cloud services dominate, the ability to self-host applications gives you unparalleled control, privacy, and understanding of your infrastructure. Mark yourself safe from the dark patterns and unreasonable pricing models employed by Heroku et al.

### DevOps Skills are Essential

DevOps skills are more accessible than ever before. As a software engineer, being able to distribute and maintain your code in production is no longer optionalâ€”it's a must-have skill set. These guides aim to bridge the gap between development and operations, making these skills approachable for everyone.

### Open Source Advocacy

I'm a passionate advocate for open source software. The tools and technologies featured in these guides are predominantly open source, reflecting my belief in community-driven development and the freedom to inspect, modify, and share code.

### Linux Enthusiasm

My love for Linux runs deep. These guides primarily focus on Linux-based solutions because of the platform's flexibility, reliability, and powerful command-line tools that make DevOps work efficient and enjoyable.

### Current Guides

- [**Coolify + Hetzner + Plausible Analytics Setup Guide**](self-hosting-coolify-hetzner-setup-guide.md): A comprehensive walkthrough for setting up Coolify on a Hetzner server and deploying Plausible Analytics.

  While deploying projects using Docker and Docker Compose on your own server is already powerful, adding Coolify provides a user-friendly layer that makes management significantly easier. This approach offers a more fulfilling alternative to navigating the dark patterns of platforms like Heroku and Vercel.
